# OpenSRD
OpenSRD, abbreviation of Open Source Shape from Refractive Distortion, is a software tool developed for
the spatio-temporal reconstruction of a water surface.  It started as a master thesis project by Lukas Engelen
at the Hydraulics Laboratory of Ghent University and was further developed and validated in his subsequent
PhD-research.  Detailed information on the theoretical considerations, as well as the validation and accuracy
assessment, can be found in the accompanying paper.

A detailed description on how to install and use the program is given in the User manual. Please read the relevant parts of this manual before applying the technqiue.

OpenSRD is licensed under GNU GPLv3 and uses the open-source libraries OpenCV, ALGLIB and MINPACK.
